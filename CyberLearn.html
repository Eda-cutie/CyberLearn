      phishing: {
        info: `Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim navigates the site, and transverses any additional security boundaries with the victim.
<br><br> As of 2020, it is the most common type of cybercrime, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents of phishing than any other type of cybercrime. Modern phishing campaigns increasingly target multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems, not just passwords. Attackers use spoofed login pages and real-time relay tools to capture both credentials and one-time passcodes. In some cases, phishing kits are designed to bypass 2FA by immediately forwarding stolen credentials to the attacker’s server, enabling instant access. <br>
<br><p>
Types Of Phishing: <br>
<b>--> Email phishing:</b> Phishing attacks, often delivered via email spam, attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or login credentials. Most attacks are "bulk attacks" that are not targeted and are instead sent in bulk to a wide audience.<br>
<b>--> Spear phishing:</b> Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack that uses personalized messaging, especially e‑mails, to trick a specific individual or organization into believing they are legitimate. It often utilizes personal information about the target to increase the chances of success.<br>
<b>--> Voice phishing (Vishing):</b> Voice over IP (VoIP) is used in vishing or voice phishing attacks, where attackers make automated phone calls to large numbers of people, often using text-to-speech synthesizers, claiming fraudulent activity on their accounts. The attackers spoof the calling phone number to appear as if it is coming from a legitimate bank or institution. The victim is then prompted to enter sensitive information or connected to a live person who uses social engineering tactics to obtain information. Vishing takes advantage of the public's lower awareness and trust in voice telephony compared to email phishing.<br>
<b>--> SMS phishing (smishing):</b> SMS phishing or smishing is a type of phishing attack that uses text messages from a cell phone or smartphone to deliver a bait message. The victim is usually asked to click a link, call a phone number, or contact an email address provided by the attacker.<br>
<b>--> Page hijacking:</b> Page hijacking involves redirecting users to malicious websites or exploit kits through the compromise of legitimate web pages, often using cross site scripting.<br>
<b>--> QR code phishing (quishing):</b> In "quishing" (QR code phishing), scammers exploit the convenience of QR codes to trick users into giving up sensitive data, by scanning a code containing an embedded malicious web site link.<br>
<b>--> Man-in-the-Middle phishing:</b> Traditional phishing attacks are typically limited to capturing user credentials directly inputted into fraudulent websites. However, the advent of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing techniques has significantly advanced the sophistication of these attacks, enabling cybercriminals to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms during a user's active session on a web service.<br>

        info: `A password attack is a cyberattack where a hacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system, network, or account by exploiting weak or compromised passwords. Attackers use various methods to determine user passwords and gain access to sensitive data. <br><br>
Types of Password Attacks<br><p>
<b>--> Brute-Force Attack:</b> The attacker uses automated software to try every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.<br>
<b>--> Dictionary Attack:</b> The attacker uses a list of common words and phrases from a dictionary to try and guess the password.<br>
<b>--> Hybrid Attack:</b> A combination of brute-force and dictionary attacks, where the attacker starts with dictionary words and then adds numbers and characters to the end.<br> 
<b>--> Phishing:</b> A deceptive method where attackers trick users into revealing their passwords by impersonating legitimate websites or services.<br> 
<b>--> Keylogger:</b> Malware that records keystrokes on a victim's computer, capturing passwords as they are typed.<br> 
<b>--> Password Spraying:</b> A reverse brute-force attack where the attacker uses a few common passwords and tries them against many different usernames<br>
<br> Why Password Attacks Are a Threat:<br>
<b>--> Data Breaches:</b> Passwords are the first line of defense for digital accounts, and a compromised password can lead to serious data breaches.<br>
<b>--> Exploiting Human Error:</b> Many password attacks rely on users choosing weak, easily guessed passwords or reusing the same password across multiple accounts.<br> 
<b>--> Automation:</b> Attackers use specialized tools and even AI to automate the process of cracking passwords, making attacks faster and more efficient.<br><br>

      malware: {
        info: `Malware (a portmanteau of malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive access to information, or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.<br>Malware poses serious problems to individuals and businesses on the Internet. According to Symantec's 2018 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has increased to 669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016. Cybercrime, which includes malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by computer, was predicted to cost the world economy US$6 trillion in 2021, and is increasing at a rate of 15% per year.<br><br>Types Of Malware:<br><p>
<b>--> Virus:</b> A computer virus is software usually hidden within another seemingly harmless program that can produce copies of itself and insert them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a harmful action (such as destroying data).<br>
<b>--> Worm:</b> A worm is a stand-alone malware software that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers and can copy itself without infecting files. These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires the user to run an infected software or operating system for the virus to spread, whereas a worm spreads itself.<br>
<b>--> Rootkits:</b> Once malicious software is installed on a system, it is essential that it stays concealed, to avoid detection. Software packages known as rootkits allow this concealment, by modifying the host's operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a harmful process from being visible in the system's list of processes, or keep its files from being read.<br>
<b>--> Backdoors:</b> A backdoor is a broad term for a computer program that allows an attacker persistent unauthorised remote access to a victim's machine often without their knowledge. The attacker typically uses another attack (such as a trojan, worm or virus) to bypass authentication mechanisms usually over an unsecured network such as the Internet to install the backdoor application. A backdoor can also be a side effect of a software bug in legitimate software that is exploited by an attacker to gain access to a victim's computer or network.<br>
<b>--> Trojan Horses:</b> A Trojan horse misrepresents itself to masquerade as a regular, benign program or utility in order to persuade a victim to install it. A Trojan horse usually carries a hidden destructive function that is activated when the application is started.<br>
<b>--> Ransomware:</b> Ransomware prevents a user from accessing their files until a ransom is paid. There are two variations of ransomware, being crypto ransomware and locker ransomware. Locker ransomware just locks down a computer system without encrypting its contents, whereas crypto ransomware locks down a system and encrypts its contents. For example, programs such as CryptoLocker encrypt files securely, and only decrypt them on payment of a substantial sum of money.<br>
<b>--> Grayware:</b> Grayware is any unwanted application or file that can worsen the performance of computers and may cause security risks but which there is insufficient consensus or data to classify them as malware. Types of grayware typically include spyware, adware, fraudulent dialers, joke programs ("jokeware") and remote access tools. For example, at one point, Sony BMG compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers' computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying.<br><br>Data loaded from trusted sources</p><br><br>`,

      hacking: {
        info: `Hacking first appeared as a term in the 1970s but became more popular through the next decade. An article in a 1980 edition of Psychology Today ran the headline “The Hacker Papers” in an exploration of computer usage's addictive nature. Two years later, two movies, Tron and WarGames, were released, in which the lead characters set about hacking into computer systems, which introduced the concept of hacking to a wide audience and as a potential national security risk.<br>
Sure enough, later that year, a group of teenagers cracked the computer systems of major organizations like Los Alamos National Laboratory, Security Pacific Bank, and Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A Newsweek article covering the event became the first to use the word “hacker” in the negative light it now holds.<br><br>In cybersecurity, hacking is the act of exploiting weaknesses in computer systems or networks to gain unauthorized access, control, or information. While the term often carries negative connotations associated with cybercrime and malicious intent, such as financial gain or espionage, it can also describe the work of ethical hackers who use their skills to find and fix vulnerabilities for defensive purposes.<br><br>Types of Hackers:<br><p>
<b>--> Black Hat Hackers:</b> These are the criminals of the cybersecurity world, engaging in unauthorized access for malicious purposes.<br>
<b>--> White Hat Hackers:</b> They operate with permission to find vulnerabilities and help organizations strengthen their security.<br>
<b>--> Grey Hat Hackers:</b> These hackers may act without permission but typically intend to inform the targeted organization of any discovered vulnerabilities.<br><br>Data loaded from trusted sources</p><br><br>`,

        info: `In computing, a <b>denial-of-service attack (DoS attack)</b> is a cyberattack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to a network. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.<br><br>In a <b>distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack)</b>, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. More sophisticated strategies are required to mitigate this type of attack; simply attempting to block a single source is insufficient as there are multiple sources. A DDoS attack is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door of a shop, making it hard for legitimate customers to enter, thus disrupting trade and losing the business money. Criminal perpetrators of DDoS attacks often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks or credit card payment gateways.<br><br>Type of Attacks:<br><p>
<b>--> Distributed DoS:</b> A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. A DDoS attack uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware.<br>
<b>--> Yo-Yo attack:</b> A yo-yo attack is a specific type of DoS/DDoS aimed at cloud-hosted applications which use autoscaling. During the attack, an attacker repeatedly changes between sending a lot of traffic (which causes a scale-up) and stopping the burst (causing a scale-down as a result).<br>
<b>--> Application layer attacks:</b> An application layer DDoS attack (sometimes referred to as layer 7 DDoS attack) is a form of DDoS attack where attackers target application-layer processes. The attack over-exercises specific functions or features of a website with the intention to disable those functions or features. This application-layer attack is different from an entire network attack, and is often used against financial institutions to distract IT and security personnel from security breaches. In 2013, application-layer DDoS attacks represented 20% of all DDoS attacks. According to research by Akamai Technologies, there have been "51 percent more application layer attacks" from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014 and "16 percent more" from Q3 2014 to Q4 2014.<br>
<b>--> Markov-modulated denial-of-service attack:</b> A Markov-modulated denial-of-service attack occurs when the attacker disrupts control packets using a hidden Markov model. A setting in which Markov-model based attacks are prevalent is online gaming as the disruption of the control packet undermines game play and system functionality.<br><br>Data loaded from trusted sources</p><br><br> `,

      antivirus: {
        info: `Antivirus software (abbreviated to AV software), also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware.<br>Antivirus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses, hence the name. However, with the proliferation of other malware, antivirus software started to protect against other computer threats. Some products also include protection from malicious URLs, spam, and phishing.<br><br>In 1987, Frederick B. Cohen demonstrated that the algorithm which would be able to detect all possible viruses can't possibly exist (like the algorithm which determines whether or not the given program halts). However, using different layers of defense, a good detection rate may be achieved.There are several methods which antivirus engines can use to identify malware:<br><p>
<b>--> Sandbox detection:</b> a particular behavioural-based detection technique that, instead of detecting the behavioural fingerprint at run time, it executes the programs in a virtual environment, logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions logged which can include memory usage and network accesses, the antivirus engine can determine if the program is malicious or not. If not, then, the program is executed in the real environment. Although this technique has shown to be quite effective, given its heaviness and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user antivirus solutions.<br><b>--> Data mining techniques:</b> one of the latest approaches applied in malware detection. Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used to try to classify the behaviour of a file (as either malicious or benign) given a series of file features, that are extracted from the file itself.<br><br>Identification methods:<br>
<b>--> Signature-based detection:</b> Traditional antivirus software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware. Substantially, when a malware sample arrives in the hands of an antivirus firm, it is analysed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then, once it is determined to be a malware, a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.<br>
<b>--> Rootkit detection:</b> Anti-virus software can attempt to scan for rootkits. A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain administrative-level control over a computer system without being detected. Rootkits can change how the operating system functions and in some cases can tamper with the anti-virus program and render it ineffective. Rootkits are also difficult to remove, in some cases requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system.<br>
<b>--> Real-time protection:</b> Real-time protection, on-access scanning, background guard, resident shield, autoprotect, and other synonyms refer to the automatic protection provided by most antivirus, anti-spyware, and other anti-malware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious objects. Real-time protection detects threats in opened files and scans apps in real-time as they are installed on the device.<br><br>Data loaded from trusted sources</p><br><br> `,

        info: `<p>In cryptography, a <b>brute-force attack or exhaustive key search</b> is a cryptanalytic attack that consists of an attacker submitting many possible keys or passwords with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. This strategy can theoretically be used to break any form of encryption that is not information-theoretically secure. However, in a properly designed cryptosystem the chance of successfully guessing the key is negligible.<br><br>When cracking passwords, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones due to diversity of characters.<br><br>Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.<br><br>Brute-force attacks are an application of brute-force search, the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one. The word 'hammering' is sometimes used to describe a brute-force attack, with 'anti-hammering' for countermeasures.<br><br>Data loaded from trusted sources</p><br><br> `,
